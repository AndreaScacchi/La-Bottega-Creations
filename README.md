# La Bottega Creations

This website provide an overview of an amazing jewerly artisan. There are information about the works, about the artisan (Email, Etsy, Facebook) and also about the privacy policy.

All components, like navbar, images, and also every section, are responsive, so you can visit the site using a mobile phone, a tablet or a computer.

Moreover, I tried to create a user-friendly website, using the modern technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Hoever, It's a static website, so to shop, you have to visit Etsy.

Finally, I created also a contact section with a video background. However, there is an issue with several devices, like Iphone, where the video is blocked, or you can't see it.

This site is continuously under construction to provide the best user experience. More features will be add in future.
